encouraging less ridiculously biased poll design

Donald Trump's [Media Accountability Survey](https://action.donaldjtrump.com/mainstream-media-accountability-survey/) is an example of really terrible survey design. In protest of how terribly biased the survey design is, we're correcting the results. Partially. You can only do so much when the survey is *this* bad. 

## Pre-requisites

1) Python (works in 3.0)

2) Jupyter Notebook

3) Selenium, Selenium Chrome Driver

## How to use:

Run media_survey_bot.ipynb in Jupyter notebook. Default loop that actually runs the script (in final cell) is set to run 6 times, but feel free to run thousands of times.

If you don't use Jupyter notebook, the code in cells of media_survey_bot.ipynb can be ported in to a normal python file and run from there.

## Issues:

Please report code base issues here on github. Help save democracy from poorly constructed survey design.
