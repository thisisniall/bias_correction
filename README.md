# bias_correction
encouraging less ridiculously biased poll design

## Pre-requisites

1) Python (works in 3.0)

2) Jupyter Notebook

3) Selenium, Selenium Chrome Driver

## How to use:

Run media_survey_bot.ipynb in Jupyter notebook. Default loop that actually runs the script (in final cell) is set to run 6 times, but feel free to run thousands of times.

If you don't use Jupyter notebook, the code in cells of media_survey_bot.ipynb can be ported in to a normal python file and run from there.

## Issues:

Please report code base issues here on github. Help save democracy from poorly constructed survey design.
